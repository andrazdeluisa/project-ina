@article{Hummon1989,
abstract = {The study of citation networks for both articles and journals is routine. In general, these analyses proceed by considering the similarity of articles or journals and submitting the set of similarity measures to some clustering or scaling procedure. Two common methods are found in bibliometric coupling, where two citing articles are similar to the extent they cite the same literature, and co-citation analysis where cited articles are similar to the extent they are cited by the same citing articles. Methods based on structural and regular equivalence also seek to partition the article based on their positional location. Such methods have in common focus on the articles and partitions of them. We propose a quite different approach where the connective threads through a network are preserved and the focus is on the links in the network rather than on the nodes. Variants of the depth first search algorithm are used to detect and represent the mainstream of the literature of a clearly delineated area of scientific research. The specific citation network is one that consists of ties among the key events and papers that lead to the discovery and modeling of DNA together with the final experimental confirmation of its representation. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

@article{Klavans2017,
abstract = {In 1965, Derek de Solla Price foresaw the day when a citation-based taxonomy of science and technology would be delineated and correspondingly used for science policy. A taxonomy needs to be comprehensive and accurate if it is to be useful for policy making, especially now that policy makers are utilizing citation-based indicators to evaluate people, institutions and laboratories. Determining the accuracy of a taxonomy, however, remains a challenge. Previous work on the accuracy of partition solutions is sparse, and the results of those studies, while useful, have not been definitive. In this study we compare the accuracies of topic-level taxonomies based on the clustering of documents using direct citation, bibliographic coupling, and co-citation. Using a set of new gold standards - articles with at least 100 references - we find that direct citation is better at concentrating references than either bibliographic coupling or co-citation. Using the assumption that higher concentrations of references denote more accurate clusters, direct citation thus provides a more accurate representation of the taxonomy of scientific and technical knowledge than either bibliographic coupling or co-citation. We also find that discipline-level taxonomies based on journal schema are highly inaccurate compared to topic-level taxonomies, and recommend against their use.},
