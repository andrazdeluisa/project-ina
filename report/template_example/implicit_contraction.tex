The exact algorithm is based on implicit contraction and deletion of edges.
The basis of this algorithm is the fact that the probability there is a path between two node $i$ and $j$ can be decomposed as follows
\begin{equation}
	\Pr(X_{ij} = 1 \mid G) = (1 - p) \Pr(X_{ij} = 1 \mid G/e) + p \Pr(X_{ij} = 1 \mid G - e)
\label{eq:recursive_path_prob}
\end{equation}
where $G/e$ denotes contraction of edge $e$ and $G - e$ the deletion of edge $e$.
\eqref{recursive_path_prob} yields a straightforward recursive method to calculate $\Pr(X_{ij} = 1)$ which can then easily be used to calculate $\Pr(X_{st}(i) = 1)$ using \eqref{decompose_intermediacy}.
However, the probability that there is a path from $i$ to $j$ can also be used to calculate the probability there is a path from $i$ to a neighbour of $j$.
In other words
\begin{equation}
	\Pr(X_{ij} = 1 \mid G) = \Pr(X_{ik} = 1 \mid G) \Pr(X_{kj} = 1 \mid G).
	\label{eq:decompose_path_prob}
\end{equation}
Hence, we would like to use the fact that we can already calculate $\Pr(X_{ik} = 1 \mid G)$ to calculate $\Pr(X_{ij} = 1 \mid G)$ more efficiently.

We can combine the two approaches in the following way.
In Eq.~\eqref{recursive_path_prob} we used an arbitrary edge $e$.
Rather than an arbitrary edge, let us use the edge $(ik)$.
We then write
\begin{equation}
	\Pr(X_{ij} = 1 \mid G) = (1 - p) \Pr(X_{ij} = 1 \mid G/(ik)) + p \Pr(X_{ij} = 1 \mid G - (ik))
\end{equation}
Now observe that $\Pr(X_{ik} = 1 \mid G/(ik)) = 1$, and that $G/(ik)$ has a probability $(1 - p)$ of occuring.
Hence, while calculating $\Pr(X_{ij} = 1 \mid G)$ we can also calculate $\Pr(X_{ik} = 1)$.

Our exact algorithm will therefore work as follows.
We are interested in the path probabilities $\Pr(X_{si} = 1)$ (and $\Pr(X_{it} = 1$) for all nodes $i$.
Note that we will always contract to the source node.
We will perform implicit contraction and deletion of edges, and we use (1) a set of contracted nodes; (2) a set of deleted edges; and (3) a set of contracted neighbour edges to keep track of this implicit contraction and deletion.
Furthermore, we will keep track of the probability of the current state of contraction/deletion.
Every time we contract a node (which had not been contracted yet), we can then update the probability $\Pr(X_{ik} = 1)$.
