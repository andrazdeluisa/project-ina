% If your first paragraph (i.e. with the \dropcap) contains a list environment (quote, quotation, theorem, definition, enumerate, itemize...), the line after the list may have some extra indentation. If this is the case, add \parshape=0 to the end of the list environment.
\dropcap{T}his PNAS journal template is provided to help you write your work in the correct journal format.  Instructions for use are provided below. 

Note: please start your introduction without including the word ``Introduction'' as a section heading (except for math articles in the Physical Sciences section); this heading is implied in the first paragraphs.

\subsection*{Supporting Information (SI)}

Authors should submit SI as a single separate PDF file, combining all text, figures, tables, movie legends, and SI references.  PNAS will publish SI uncomposed, as the authors have provided it.  Additional details can be found here: \href{http://www.pnas.org/page/authors/journal-policies}{policy on SI}.  For SI formatting instructions click \href{https://www.pnascentral.org/cgi-bin/main.plex?form_type=display_auth_si_instructions}{here}.  The PNAS Overleaf SI template can be found \href{https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/pnas-template-for-supplementary-information/wqfsfqwyjtsd}{here}.  Refer to the SI Appendix in the manuscript at an appropriate point in the text. Number supporting figures and tables starting with S1, S2, etc.

Authors who place detailed materials and methods in an SI Appendix must provide sufficient detail in the main text methods to enable a reader to follow the logic of the procedures and results and also must reference the SI methods. If a paper is fundamentally a study of a new method or technique, then the methods must be described completely in the main text.


\matmethods{Please describe your materials and methods here. This can be more than one paragraph, and may contain subsections and equations as required. Authors should include a statement in the methods section describing how readers will be able to access the data in the paper.
