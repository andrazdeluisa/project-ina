% If your first paragraph (i.e. with the \dropcap) contains a list environment (quote, quotation, theorem, definition, enumerate, itemize...), the line after the list may have some extra indentation. If this is the case, add \parshape=0 to the end of the list environment.
\dropcap{S}haring ideas, problems and solutions is a fundamental reason why humans are as advanced as they are today.
This is true in all fields of science: biology, physics, mathematics and potentially even more so in computer science.
With the advancements in technology and specifically the internet in the last couple of decades, 
cooperation between researchers and innovators has never been easier.
This is in large part due to Git and other version control systems, 
which allow both researchers and software developers to interact and collaborate on projects with ease,
in turn leading to faster learning, innovation and development of scientific and technological advancements.

But this network has a big drawback: it is a social network.
And as a social network, it has its linchpins - key members of a society which hold everything together.
Without them the network might fall apart. 
These are the people who introduce others. 
The keys that connect people into a community.
And this is what we are interested in.

If we are able to find a community structure in the GitHub network of collaborators \cite{github-network}, 
we can then try to measure how "well connected" each community is.
Using this measure as a criterion, we can then start looking for linchpins - 
in this case nodes, which if removed, would destabilize the community structure of the network as much as possible.
In the real world social network this means removing individuals that we think contribute most to the development of new ideas and projects.
Not necessarily provide solutions themselves, but by connecting others and creating (or just being the core of) communities, contribute to
further technological advancements the most.

In this paper we analyse the ability of several node centrality measures to highlight these crucial nodes for the robustness of the community structure in social networks.
